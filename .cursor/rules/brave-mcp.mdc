# Brave MCP Usage

- When you need to look up **current information**, run **web searches**, or fetch **live documentation**, prefer using the **Brave MCP provider** (if available in this environment).
- Use Brave MCP for:
  - Up-to-date technical docs and API references
  - General web research needed to answer questions
  - Checking external articles, blogs, or news
- Continue to rely on repository code and local tools for anything that can be answered **without** web access.

# API Key & Configuration (user responsibility)

- The Brave MCP server should be configured to read an environment variable (for example `BRAVE_API_KEY`) instead of hard‑coding secrets in the repo.
- Make sure you have:
  - Set your Brave API key in your local Cursor / system environment
  - Wired that environment variable into the Brave MCP server configuration (e.g. in your global `mcp.json`).
